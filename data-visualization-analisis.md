# **Data Visualization in Data Analysis**

Data visualization is a fundamental part of data analysis, as it allows us to detect patterns, errors, inconsistencies, communicate findings effectively, and document changes in the data cleansing process. A well-designed visualization facilitates decision-making and helps tell a story with the data, adapting the presentation according to the audience.

---

## **1. Importance of Data Visualization**
### **Detecting Errors, Inconsistencies, and Outliers**
During exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations help identify problems such as:
- **Outliers**: Observed in boxplots, scatter plots, or histograms.
- **Missing data**: Identified with heatmaps of null values or count plots of missing data.
- **Encoding errors**: Bar charts can reveal unexpected categorical values (e.g., "M", "Male", "Man" as separate values for gender).
- **Unexpected trends in time series data**: Line charts can reveal sudden changes or anomalies.

**Example of visualizing errors**  
Before cleaning customer income data, a **boxplot** might show an unusually high number of extreme or negative values. After corrections (removing outliers or fixing erroneous entries), the **updated boxplot** should show a more coherent distribution.

---

## **2. Documenting the Before and After of Data Cleansing**
A crucial aspect of data analysis is documenting the cleaning process. To demonstrate how data has been transformed and improved, it is useful to visualize the data before and after applying processes such as:
- Removing or imputing missing values.
- Correcting typographical errors.
- Handling outliers.
- Normalizing and standardizing variables.

### **Example 1: Missing Data**
Before cleaning, we can use a **heatmap of null values** to identify which columns and rows contain missing data.

**Before Cleaning**:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulated data with missing values
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, None, 40, 50, None, 60],
    'Income': [40000, None, 60000, 70000, None, 90000, 100000, None]
})

# Visualizing missing values
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.heatmap(data.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Missing Values Before Data Cleansing")
plt.show()
```
ðŸ”¹ **Interpretation**: We observe which variables have missing values and how many records are affected.

**After Cleaning** (imputing missing values with the mean, for example):
```python
# Replace missing values with column mean
data_cleaned = data.fillna(data.mean())

# New visualization after cleaning
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.heatmap(data_cleaned.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Missing Values After Data Cleansing")
plt.show()
```
ðŸ”¹ **Result**: The heatmap shows that all missing values have been filled.

---

### **Example 2: Outliers**
Outliers can distort analysis and predictive models. They can be detected using a **boxplot** and then corrected by:
- Removing extreme values.
- Applying logarithmic transformation.
- Winsorizing (replacing outliers with nearby percentiles).

#### **Before Cleaning (Outliers Present)**
```python
import numpy as np

# Simulated data with outliers
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.append(np.random.normal(50000, 10000, 100), [150000, 200000, 300000])  # Adding outliers

# Boxplot before cleaning
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.boxplot(x=data)
plt.title("Income Distribution Before Removing Outliers")
plt.show()
```
ðŸ”¹ **Interpretation**: We see extreme values far from the rest of the data.

#### **After Cleaning (Outliers Removed or Transformed)**
```python
# Removing values above the 95th percentile
data_cleaned = data[data < np.percentile(data, 95)]

# Boxplot after cleaning
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.boxplot(x=data_cleaned)
plt.title("Income Distribution After Removing Outliers")
plt.show()
```
ðŸ”¹ **Result**: The influence of extreme values has been removed, achieving a more representative distribution.

## **3. Processes and Best Practices in Creating Visualizations**
### **1. Initial Data Exploration**
- Use histograms to understand distributions.
- Plot correlations between variables with heatmaps.
- Create boxplots to detect extreme values.

### **2. Data Validation and Cleaning**
- Use scatter plots to identify anomalous relationships.
- Compare charts before and after imputing missing values.
- Check consistency with bar charts or Pareto charts.

### **3. Communicating Results**
- Use advanced plots like violin plots for detailed analysis.
- Create interactive dashboards to present insights.
- Use visual storytelling to emphasize conclusions.

---

## **4. Tools for Data Visualization**
- **Python**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `altair`.
- **R**: `ggplot2`, `shiny`.
- **BI Tools**: Tableau, Power BI, Looker.
- **Interactive Libraries**: D3.js, Bokeh, Dash.

---

## **5. Choosing the Right Visualization**
### **Based on Data Type**
| Analysis Type | Recommended Charts |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Distribution | Histogram, KDE plot, Boxplot |
| Category Comparison | Bar chart, Pie chart (in limited cases) |
| Variable Relationships | Scatter plot, Heatmap, Pairplot |
| Time Evolution | Line chart, Time series plot |

### **Based on Audience**
- **Data Analysts**: Detailed charts with statistical metrics.
- **Executives**: Interactive dashboards with key insights.
- **General Public**: Simple visualizations with clear storytelling.

**Example of Choosing a Visualization**  
To show sales trends, a **line chart** is ideal. To compare product performance, a **bar chart** works best. If we want to display customer income distribution, a **histogram or violin plot** is the best choice.

# **Data Validation and Data Verification in Data Analysis**

In data analysis, **validation** and **verification** are two fundamental processes to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and useful for decision-making.

---

## **1. Difference Between Data Validation and Data Verification**  

| **Concept**    | **Data Validation** | **Data Verification** |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Definition** | The process of checking whether data meets predefined rules and criteria. | The process of ensuring that data has been entered, transferred, and stored correctly. |
| **Objective** | Ensuring data is correct and useful. | Confirming that data has not been changed or corrupted during the process. |
| **When It Is Done** | Before and after data is entered into a system. | During data transfer or storage. |
| **Example** | Checking if an email has a valid format (`name@domain.com`). | Comparing values from an original database with a copy to ensure no alterations. |

Both processes are essential to maintaining data quality.

---

## **2. Techniques for Validating and Verifying Data Quality**  

There are several techniques and approaches to ensure data quality. Some of the most commonly used include:

### **2.1. Identifying Data Issues**  

| **Issue**         | **Description** |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Missing Values** | Missing data in critical columns can affect analysis. |
| **Duplicates** | Repeated records can cause errors in calculations and reports. |
| **Formatting Errors** | Poorly structured data, such as dates in different formats (`DD/MM/YYYY` vs. `YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| **Outliers** | Data points that deviate significantly from expected behavior, indicating potential errors or anomalies. |

---

### **2.2. Methods to Detect Issues**  

1. **Detecting Missing Values**  
   - Use `isnull()` or `isna()` in Python (Pandas) to find missing data.  
   - Manually reviewing data in tools like Excel or Power BI.  
   - Applying business rules (e.g., if a user has a purchase, they must have a valid ID).  

2. **Identifying Duplicates**  
   - `duplicated()` in Python or SQL (`GROUP BY` with `COUNT(*) > 1`).  
   - Visual review in spreadsheets using filters.  

3. **Formatting Errors**  
   - Validations with regular expressions (`regex`) for emails, zip codes, etc.  
   - Standardizing date and number formats.  

4. **Detecting Outliers**  
   - Using statistical methods like **Z-score** or **IQR (Interquartile Range)**.  
   - Visualizing with box plots in Python, R, or Power BI.  
   - Business-specific rules (e.g., an age greater than 120 years is suspicious).
