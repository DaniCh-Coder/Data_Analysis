# Standardization of Addresses in Customer Databases
As a data analyst, I understand that address standardization is a critical component of the data cleaning process. Poorly structured addresses can lead to duplicates, shipping errors, and incorrect analysis.

## Best Practices for Address Standardization

### 1. Recommended Address Field Structure
It is advisable to split the address into multiple fields to facilitate searches, analysis, and validations:

- **Street type** (Street, Avenue, Road, etc.)  
- **Street name**  
- **Number/Building**  
- **Floor/Level**  
- **Apartment/Unit**  
- **Neighborhood/District**  
- **City/Town**  
- **State/Province/Region**  
- **Country**  
- **Postal Code**  
- **Geographic coordinates** (latitude/longitude)  

### 2. Component Normalization
- **Consistent abbreviations**: Establish rules for abbreviations (e.g., "Ave." for Avenue, "St." for Street).  
- **Upper/lower case**: Decide on a uniform format (recommended: capitalize the first letter).  
- **Special characters**: Remove or standardize accents, umlauts, etc.  
- **Numeric formatting**: Establish consistent patterns for numbers (e.g., "1st" vs. "1").  

### 3. Validation with Official Sources
- **National postal services**: Cross-check with official databases such as USPS (USA), Royal Mail (UK), Correos (Spain), etc.  
- **Cadastral records**: Validate against official property registry information.  
- **Normalization APIs**: Use services like:  
  - Google Maps Geocoding API  
  - HERE Geocoding API  
  - ArcGIS Geocoding  
  - DataCleaner Address Cleaner  

### 4. Geocoding
Converting addresses into geographic coordinates provides significant advantages:  
- Enables precise location tracking  
- Facilitates geospatial analysis  
- Helps identify non-obvious duplicates  
- Allows visualization on maps  

### 5. Cleaning and Standardization Process
- **Parsing**: Break unstructured addresses into components.  
- **Correction**: Apply normalization rules.  
- **Enrichment**: Fill in missing information.  
- **Geolocation**: Add coordinates.  
- **Verification**: Cross-check with official sources.  
- **Deduplication**: Identify and unify duplicate records.  

### 6. Continuous Maintenance and Management
- **Regular updates**: Addresses change (renamed streets, administrative reorganizations).  
- **Update system**: Implement processes to update addresses periodically.  
- **Change history**: Maintain a record of modifications for traceability.  
- **Feedback loop**: Establish mechanisms to report address errors.  

### 7. Recommended Tools
- **ETL Tools**: Talend, Informatica, Microsoft SSIS.  
- **Specific Libraries**: libpostal (open source).  
- **SaaS Services**: SmartyStreets, Melissa Data, CARTO.  
- **Spatial Databases**: PostGIS, SQL Server Spatial.  

### 8. Regional Considerations
- Adapt the model to the specifics of each country.  
- Consider differences in address formats (Anglo-Saxon vs. Latin American countries).  
- Take into account local regulations on nomenclature.  

### 9. Quality Indicators
To measure process effectiveness:  
- Percentage of standardized addresses.  
- Match rate with official sources.  
- Geocoding accuracy.  
- Successful delivery rate (if applicable).  

Address standardization is an ongoing process that requires continuous maintenance, but the return on investment is reflected in better analysis, more effective communications, and optimized customer experiences.

## Address Standardization Process in Databases
Address standardization involves normalizing formats, correcting errors, and validating data against official sources. This process improves data quality and facilitates further analysis.

### 1. Basic Preprocessing
**Initial cleaning:**
- Remove non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., #, *, @ unrelated to the address).
- Convert everything to uppercase or lowercase to standardize formats.
- Correct common typos (e.g., "Street" vs. "Alley").

**Example of transformation:**  
`"Calle 5 # 12-45"` → `"CALLE 5 #12-45"`

### 2. Component Segmentation
Divide the address into structured elements:  
- Street  
- Number  
- Additional details (Floor, Apartment)  
- Neighborhood/Urbanization  
- City/Town/District  
- Province/State  
- Postal Code  

### 3. Validation Against External Sources
**Reference databases:**  
- **Municipal cadastral records**: Verify the existence of streets and numbers.  
- **Postal services**: Confirm postal codes and their relationship to cities.  
- **Property records**: Cross-check with registered addresses.  
- **Geographical APIs (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)**: Validate geolocation.  

### 4. Format Normalization
**Common standards:**  
- Abbreviations: `"CL"` for `"Calle"`, `"KR"` for `"Carrera"`.  
- Term unification: `"URBANIZACION"` → `"URB."` or `"Urbanización"`.  
- Numerical consistency: `#12-45` → `12-45` (remove redundant symbols).  

### 5. Handling Inconsistencies
**Common cases:**  
- **Incomplete addresses**: Use APIs to fill in missing fields (e.g., Google Maps).  
- **Nonexistent addresses**: Mark as **INVALID** and require manual verification.  
- **Ambiguous addresses**: Prioritize official sources (e.g., prefer cadastral data over historical records).  

### 6. Documentation and Auditing
- **Change log**: Record transformations applied to each record.  
- **Quality metrics**: Calculate the percentage of validated vs. non-validated addresses.

## Country-Specific Standardization Examples

### 1. United States
**USPS Standard Format:**  
`FULL_NAME | STREET_NUMBER STREET_TYPE_ABBR | CITY STATE_ABBR ZIP_CODE`

```python
import re

def standardize_us_address(address):
    address = address.upper().replace("#", "").replace(",", "")
    abbreviations = {
        'STREET': 'ST', 'DRIVE': 'DR', 'AVENUE': 'AVE',
        'BOULEVARD': 'BLVD', 'APARTMENT': 'APT'
    }
    pattern = r'(\d+)\s+(.*?)\s+([A-Z]{2})\s+(\d{5}(?:-\d{4})?)'
    match = re.search(pattern, address)

    if match:
        number, street, state, zipcode = match.groups()
        for key, val in abbreviations.items():
            street = street.replace(key, val)
        return f"{number} {street} {state} {zipcode}"
    
    return "INVALID ADDRESS"
```

This approach ensures compliance with international postal standards and enables integration with logistics systems like FedEx or USPS.

### 2. Canada
**Canada Post Standard Format:**

`NAME | STREET_NUMBER STREET_TYPE | CITY PROVINCE_ABBR POSTAL_CODE`

PostgreSQL SQL Code:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION standardize_ca_address(address TEXT)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
   postal_code TEXT;
   province TEXT;
BEGIN
   postal_code := (SELECT regexp_matches(address, '[A-Z]\d[A-Z] \d[A-Z]\d'))[1];

   province := CASE
       WHEN address ~ 'ONTARIO' THEN 'ON'
       WHEN address ~ 'QUEBEC' THEN 'QC'
       ELSE 'OTHER'
   END;

   RETURN upper(address) || ' ' || postal_code;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
