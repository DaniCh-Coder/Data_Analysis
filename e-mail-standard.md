# Email Address Standardization in Data Cleansing

Email address standardization is a fundamental component of the data cleansing process. Unlike telephone numbers, email addresses follow a more uniform international structure, but they present their own challenges.

## Standards and Norms for Emails

Standards serve to:
- Format: Ensure email addresses follow the standard format (name@domain.com)
- Validation: Use tools to verify the existence and validity of email addresses
- Privacy and Security: Comply with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA when handling email data

### 1. RFC 5322 (Internet Message Format)
- Establishes the formal syntax for email messages
- Defines the valid structure: local-part@domain
- Determines allowed characters and technical restrictions

### 2. RFC 6531 (SMTPUTF8)
- Allows international characters (Unicode) in both parts of the email
- Relevant for internationalized domains (IDN) and non-Latin names

### 3. RFC 8398 (Email Authentication Status)
- Establishes mechanisms to verify email authenticity
- Important for filtering false or malicious emails

## Email Standardization Process

### 1. Basic Cleaning
- Space removal: Remove spaces at the beginning, end, and within the email
- Uppercase normalization: Convert everything to lowercase (emails are case-insensitive)
- Invalid character removal: Filter out characters not allowed according to RFC 5322

### 2. Structural Validation
- Syntactic verification: Check basic local-part@domain.tld pattern
- Domain validation: Verify domain has a valid format with correct TLD
- Special character check: Validate appropriate use of dots, hyphens, etc.

### 3. Advanced Validation
- MX records verification: Check if the domain has valid MX records
- SMTP test: Verify mailbox existence (without sending email)
- Disposable domain detection: Identify temporary email services
- Specific syntax verification: Particular rules for certain domains

### 4. Normalization and Standardization
- Alias removal: Convert Gmail addresses with + or . to their canonical form
- Common domain correction: Fix typographical errors in popular domains
- Format consistency: Apply coherent conventions

### 5. Enrichment (Optional)
- Categorization: Classify as personal, corporate, educational, etc.
- Corporate domain association: Link with company information
- Risk assessment: Score based on trust factors

## Best Current Practices

### 1. Storage
- Preserve original form: Store the email as entered
- Store normalized version: Maintain a standardized version for searches
- Validation field: Include verification status indicator

### 2. Processing
- Real-time validation: Verify during data capture
- Correction suggestions: Offer alternatives for common errors
- Periodic cleaning process: Regularly review and update data
- Duplicate removal: Remove duplicate addresses to avoid resource waste and improve efficiency
- Inactive email removal: Identify and remove email addresses showing no activity in a specific period (usually 6-12 months)
- Double Opt-In: Confirm subscriber intention through a double opt-in process to ensure voluntary and valid emails
- Segmentation: Organize email list into segments to send relevant content and improve open rates

### 3. Special Considerations for Corporate Emails
- Standard format: Identify and apply corporate patterns (name.lastname@company.com)
- Directory validation: Compare with LDAP or Active Directory when possible
- Alias and redirection treatment: Normalize to the main address
- Multiple domain management: Properly handle companies with several domains

### 4. Privacy Treatment
- GDPR/CCPA Compliance: Implement appropriate retention and use policies
- Pseudonymization: When appropriate for privacy reasons
- Opt-out management: Mark addresses that have requested no communications

### 3. Basic Regular Expressions
For initial validation (though not sufficient for complete validation):
`^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`

## Python Implementation Example

```python
import re
import dns.resolver
import smtplib

from email_validator import validate_email, EmailNotValidError

def standardize_email(email_input):
    # Basic cleaning
    clean_email = email_input.strip().lower()

    # Basic syntactic validation
    email_pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    if not re.match(email_pattern, clean_email):
        return {
            "status": "invalid",
            "message": "Invalid email format",
            "original": email_input,
            "cleaned": None
        }

    # Correction of common domain errors
    common_domains = {
        'gmail.co': 'gmail.com',
        'hotmail.co': 'hotmail.com',
        'yahooo.com': 'yahoo.com',
        'outloo.com': 'outlook.com'
    }

    local_part, domain = clean_email.split('@', 1)
    if domain in common_domains:
        domain = common_domains[domain]
        clean_email = f"{local_part}@{domain}"
    
    # Gmail-specific normalization
    if domain == 'gmail.com':
        # Remove dots in local-part
        local_part = local_part.replace('.', '')
        # Remove everything after +
        if '+' in local_part:
            local_part = local_part.split('+', 1)[0]
        normalized_email = f"{local_part}@{domain}"
    else:
        normalized_email = clean_email

    # Further validation and processing code follows...
}
```

## Corporate Email Peculiarities

Corporate emails typically follow more structured patterns:
- Standardized formats:
  - name.lastname@company.com
  - initial.lastname@company.com
  - namelastname@company.com
  - name_lastname@company.com

- Specific characters: Some organizations limit permitted characters more strictly than the RFC standard
- Multiple domains: Large companies may have regional domains (company.es, company.co.uk) or specific department/division domains

## Advanced MX Validation

MX (Mail Exchange) record verification is a sophisticated technique to guarantee real message delivery. These DNS records are fundamental to email functioning, involving three key steps:

### Receiver Mail Server Identification
MX records specify which servers are authorized to receive emails for a domain.

### DNS Query Process
When sending an email to user@domain.com, your mail server:
- Searches for domain MX records using DNS
- Orders servers by priority (lower number = higher priority)
- Attempts to deliver the message to the highest priority server

### Technical Validation
- MX Existence: Verify the domain has at least one valid MX record
- Correct Configuration: Confirm listed servers are reachable and function with SMTP protocols
- Coherent Priority: Ensure multiple servers with staggered priorities for redundancy

## Limitations

Email standardization, while technically simpler than telephone number standardization, requires equal attention to maintain data quality and integrity, especially when working with large information volumes or integrating heterogeneous sources.

Crucial MX validation limitations:
- A valid MX does not guarantee the email account exists, only that the domain can receive emails
- Some domains use complex redirection services that might pass MX validation but reject specific emails
- Must be combined with other validation techniques for maximum effectiveness
