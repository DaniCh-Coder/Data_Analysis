Data Cleansing: Date and Time Standardization

In the Data Cleansing process (data validation and cleaning), one of the critical aspects is ensuring the quality of dates and times in customer or user databases. This involves normalizing formats, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring that the information is interpretable in different contexts.

1. Date and Time Standards

a) ISO 8601 (Recommended Format)

ISO 8601 is the international standard for representing dates and times in structured formats.

Recommended format:

Date: YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2024-03-25)

Date and time (UTC): YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ (example: 2024-03-25T15:30:00Z)

Date and time with time zone: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HH:MM (example: 2024-03-25T15:30:00-05:00)

The recommended format follows:

Universal format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HH:MM (e.g., 2025-03-25T17:53:00-03:00)

This format includes:

Date in year-month-day order

Separator T between date and time

Time zone offset (e.g., -03:00 for Argentina)

b) Common Formats in Different Regions

Each country uses different formats to write dates and times, which can cause errors if not standardized:

Region

Date Format

Time Format

U.S.

MM/DD/YYYY

12-hour (AM/PM)

Europe (Spain, Germany, etc.)

DD/MM/YYYY

24-hour

ISO 8601 (International)

YYYY-MM-DD

24-hour

2. Best Practices

a) Validate Consistent Formats

Convert all dates to ISO 8601 or the organization's defined standard format.

Avoid ambiguous formats like 03/04/2024 (which can be either April 3 or March 4).

Format checklist:

^\d{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])T([01][0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9](:[0-5][0-9](\.\d+)?)?([+-][0-2][0-9]:[0-5][0-9])?$  

(Regex for ISO 8601)

Basic rules:

Months between 01-12

Days matching the month (e.g., April has 30 days)

24-hour format for time

b) Handle Time Zones

Convert all dates and times to UTC for storage and perform conversions according to the user's time zone when displaying them.

Normalization:
Unifying time zones: Convert all entries to UTC+0 and store the original offset:

SELECT CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires', timestamp);

c) Correct Input Errors

Detect impossible dates (2024-02-30, 2023-13-05).

Identify incorrect values (0000-00-00, 99/99/9999).

Set valid date ranges according to context (e.g., avoid future birth dates).

d) Detect Missing or Incomplete Data

Apply rules to handle missing dates (NULL, N/A).

Complete dates with missing data when possible (e.g., if only 2024-03 is available, infer 2024-03-01).

e) Convert Text Dates to Real Dates

Some databases store dates as text (varchar). These must be converted to the correct data type (DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP).

3. Date and Time Standardization Process

Identify formats in the database

Check how dates are stored (STRING, DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP).

Identify inconsistencies in formats.

Convert to a single format

Convert all dates to the chosen standard format (preferably ISO 8601).

If stored as text, convert to a date type.

Correct common errors

Replace invalid values.

Remove unwanted characters (/, . or - if necessary).

Adjust time zones.

Normalize time zones

Store all dates in UTC.

Convert to the user’s time zone when displaying data.

Validate data quality

Compare data before and after transformation.

Use business rules to verify consistency.

4. Quality Control Based on Business Rules

a) Component Separation

In some cases, separating components is justified. For example:

Original Field

Normalized Fields

2025-03-25T17:53-03:00

Date: 2025-03-25, Time: 17:53, Zone: -03:00

b) Case Rules

Control date logic according to the case. For example:

birth_date ≤ registration_date

event_time must be between 08:00-20:00 (business hours)

5. Tools for Date Validation and Cleansing

a) Programming Language Tools

Python (Pandas and datetime)

import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['03/25/2024', '25-03-2024', '2024/03/25']})
df['standardized_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce', dayfirst=True)
print(df)

SQL (Conversion and Validation in Databases)

SELECT
   original_date,
   STR_TO_DATE(original_date, '%d/%m/%Y') AS converted_date
FROM user_table;

b) Power BI and Power Query

In Power Query, use the Date.FromText() function to convert text strings into dates.

Transform dates in different formats and unify them.

c) ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Tools

Talend and Alteryx allow cleaning and standardizing dates in ETL processes.

AWS Data Wrangler has advanced date normalization functions.

d) Data Quality Platforms

OpenRefine: Detects date errors and corrects inconsistencies.

Trifacta: Facilitates cleaning and transforming data before loading into databases.

Conclusion

Standardizing dates and times is essential to avoid database errors and ensure consistency in analysis. The best practice is to use ISO 8601 as the standard format, store data in UTC, validate data with strict rules, and use tools such as Python (Pandas), SQL, Power BI, and ETL tools to automate the process.
