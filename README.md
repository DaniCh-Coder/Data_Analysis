# Data Analysis Project
In this repo, I want to share some basics of data analysis, especially those concepts that are essential for any data project in its initial phase. This is because it's essential for any data project to start well in order to finish well.

# Introduction to Data Analysis

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

## Key Phases in a Data Project:
1. **Problem Definition**: Understanding the objective of the analysis.
2. **Data Collection**: Gathering the necessary data.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data for analysis.
4. **Exploratory Analysis**: Exploring the data to identify patterns.
5. **Modeling**: Applying statistical or machine learning techniques.
6. **Interpretation and Communication**: Presenting the results clearly.

## Importance of the Initial Phase:
A good start ensures that the data is ready for analysis, avoiding issues such as biases, errors, or lack of quality in the results.

## Data Cleaning and Data Cleansing
There are similarities but also differences:
### 1. Data cleaning and data cleansing are the same thing
Some authors argue that data cleaning and data clearing are the same thing. From this perspective, the following is true:
Data cleansing and data cleaning are essentially the same. Both terms refer to the process of identifying and correcting or eliminating errors, inconsistencies, and inaccurate data in a data set.
### 2. Data cleansing is more than just data cleaning
Some experts argue that data cleansing goes beyond data cleaning, and this assertion is based on the differences between the two concepts. Although the terms are often used interchangeably, they have nuances that distinguish them in the context of data management.

# **Table of Contents: Data Project Management**

## 1. [**Methodologies for Data Project Management**](methodology-analysis.md)
   - The most widely used methodologies in data project management, such as **CRISP-DM**, **SEMMA**, **TDSP**, and **Agile Data Science**.

## 2. [**Data for a Project**](data-needed-for-project.md)
   - How to identify and select the necessary data for a project. This includes defining data sources (internal and external), the relevance of the data to the project's objectives, and how to ensure the data is suitable for analysis. 

## 3. [**Utility Function of Data**](DUF-of-data-project.md)
   - How data generates value for the business or project. How data can be used to make informed decisions, optimize processes, predict trends, or solve specific problems.

## 4. [**Data and Metadata**](data-metadata.md)
   - The importance of metadata (data about data) in a project. How metadata helps in understanding the origin, structure, meaning, and quality of data.

## 5. [**Data and Structures. Documentation**](data-structures-documentation.md)
   - Different types of data structures (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) and how to handle them in a project. Relational databases, NoSQL, JSON files, XML, and others. How to choose the right data structure based on the project's needs. Documentation.

## 6. [**Data Normalization**](data-normalization.md)
   - Organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and establishing relationships between them using primary and foreign keys.

## 7. [**Data Validation and Verification**](data-validation-verification.md)
   - Techniques and tools for verifying data quality and consistency. Identifying missing values, duplicates, formatting errors, and outliers. Diagnosis. 

## 8. [**Data Cleaning**](data-cleaning.md)
   - Processing an cleaning dirty data
   - It is also important to mention how to establish data validation processes to ensure reliability before using the data for analysis.

## 9 [**Data Cleansing**](data-cleansing.md)
   - Standarization, depuration and enrichment after data cleaning

## 10. [**Data Visualization**](data-visualization-analisis.md)
   - The importance of data visualization for effectively communicating insights and results. Best practices for creating charts and dashboards, as well as the most commonly used tools (Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, etc.). How to choose the right type of visualization based on the target audience and the data being represented.
