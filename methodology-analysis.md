# Data Analisys Metodologies

One of the methodologies for data analysis (there are many) is CRISP-DM.

CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is a widely used and established methodology for guiding data mining and machine learning projects. CRISP-DM provides a structured approach to help organizations and data scientists manage and execute data-driven projects effectively.

The CRISP-DM methodology is divided into six main phases:

## **Business Understanding**:
In this phase, the project's objectives and goals are defined, and the problem to be solved or the opportunity to be leveraged is clearly identified. It involves understanding the business context, specifying the project's objectives, and creating a plan to achieve those goals.

## **Data Understanding**:
Here, data sources are identified, collected, and explored. Data quality is assessed, and initial insights into the data are obtained. The goal is to understand the nature and structure of the available data and how it relates to the project's objectives.

## **Data Preparation**:
This phase involves data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, transforming, and integrating the data. The goal is to create a well-prepared dataset for subsequent analysis. Data preparation is a crucial step to ensure accurate and meaningful results.

## **Modeling**:
This phase involves selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, building and training models using the prepared data, and tuning model parameters for optimal performance. The goal is to develop predictive or descriptive models that can address the business objectives.

## **Evaluation**:
In this phase, the performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics and techniques. Models are tested with new, previously unseen data to assess their generalization capability and effectiveness in meeting the project's objectives.

## **Deployment**:
The final models that have been evaluated and deemed satisfactory are deployed into a production environment where they can begin generating value for the business. This phase includes integrating the models into existing systems and processes.

Each of these phases is iterative and may require revisiting previous phases as new insights are gained or objectives change. CRISP-DM provides a framework for systematically progressing through these phases and helps ensure that data mining projects are well-structured, well-documented, and aligned with business needs.

CRISP-DM is a versatile methodology that can be adapted to various types of data-driven projects, not limited to data mining but also encompassing broader data science and machine learning initiatives.

CRISP-DM remains a highly respected and widely used methodology, especially in data mining and data science projects. However, over time, other frameworks and methodologies have emerged that complement or compete with CRISP-DM in certain aspects. Here are some of them:

## Other frameworks and methodologies:

### **SEMMA** (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess):
Developed by SAS, it is similar to CRISP-DM but more focused on the use of SAS tools.

### **TDSP** (Team Data Science Process):
Developed by Microsoft, it is a more modern framework that integrates DevOps practices and focuses on cloud-based data science projects.

### **KDD** (Knowledge Discovery in Databases):
A more academic process that focuses on extracting knowledge from data.

### **Agile Data Science**:
Adapts agile principles (such as Scrum) to data science projects, making it more flexible for dynamic environments.

## Why is CRISP-DM still relevant?

### **Simplicity and clarity**:
CRISP-DM is easy to understand and apply, making it ideal for small or medium-sized projects.

### **Flexibility**:
It can be adapted to a wide variety of projects and technologies.

### **Solid foundation**:
Many modern methodologies take elements from CRISP-DM and combine them with new practices.
